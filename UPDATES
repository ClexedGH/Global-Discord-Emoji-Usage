Heya, this project has been in the works as of March 25th 2024, and as of right now there is no noteable progress on the project.
However, I can give you a little background as to how all of this started.
Be warned, it's pretty dumb lmao
The conversation that started the project went something a little bit like this:
Jkreindeer: 'Think about it what if discord had an app thats like a keyboard app and you hook your discord shit up to it to gain access to server emojis so you can use them in Snapchat messages etc and they cant get access to it unless they have discord installed'
Jkreindeer: 'Think about my yapping session'
Clexed: 'You might be onto something'
From here, I started searching for the quickest way to start the project, as I have done nothing like this before.
If anyone has any ideas on how to do this, feel free to DM it to jdkmclexed on Discord.
